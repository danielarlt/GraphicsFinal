# Untitled FPS Game
This project is a WIP. You'll need to run 'world.html' on a browser with local CORS policy bypassed.

In Firefox, this can be done by navigating to about:config, and setting "security.fileuri.strict_origin_policy" to false.

## Controls
Control the player with WASD and the mouse. Left click fires the gun, right click aims the gun. Space bar can be used to jump,
left shift can be used to sprint, and f can be used to toggle flight.
